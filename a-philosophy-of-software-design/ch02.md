# Nature Of Complexity

* Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.
* The overall complexity of a system (`C`) is determined by the complexity of each part `p` (`cp`) weighted by the fraction of time developers spend working on that part (`tp`). Isolating complexity in a place where it will never be seen is almost as good as eliminating the complexity entirely.
* Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers. If you write a piece of code and it seems simple to you, but other people think it is complex, then it is complex.
* Symptoms of Complexity:
  1. Change Amplification: A seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places. One of the goals of good design is to reduce the amount of code that is affected by each design decision, so design changes donâ€™t require very many code modifications.
  2. Cognitive Load: This refers to how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task. Sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code is actually simpler, because it reduces cognitive load. E.g. using a framework would take around 5 lines to achieve something but adds cognitive load in terms of understanding what those 5 lines do. It's quite possible that a non-framework based 40 line solution might have less cognitive load than the 5 line one.
  3. Unknown unknowns: It's not clear which pieces of code must be modified to complete a given task or what information a developr must have to carry out a task successfully.
