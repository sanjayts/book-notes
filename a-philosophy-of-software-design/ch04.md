# Modules Should Be Deep

1. In modular design, a software system is decomposed into a collection of modules that are relatively independent. Modules can take many forms, such as classes, subsystems, or services. The goal of modular design is to minimize the dependencies between modules.
2. In order to manage dependencies, we think of each module in two parts: an interface and an implementation. The interface consists of everything that a developer working in a different module must know in order to use the given module.
3. The best modules are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations. If a module’s interface is much simpler than its implementation, there will be many aspects of the module that can be changed without affecting other modules.
4. The interface to a module contains two kinds of information: formal and informal.
5. The formal parts of an interface are specified explicitly in the code, and some of these can be checked for correctness by the programming language.
6. The informal parts are not specified in a way that can be understood or enforced by the programming language. They include its high-level behavior, such as the fact that a function deletes the file named by one of its arguments. If there are constraints on the usage of a class (perhaps one method must be called before another), these are also part of the class’s interface. In general, if a developer needs to know a particular piece of information in order to use a module, then that information is part of the module’s interface. The informal aspects of an interface can only be described using comments, and the programming language cannot ensure that the description is complete or accurate.
