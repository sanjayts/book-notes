# Pull Complexity Downwards

* It is more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation.
* Configuration parameters are an example of moving complexity upwards instead of down. Rather than determining a particular behavior internally, a class can export a few parameters that control its behavior, such as the size of a cache or the number of times to retry a request before giving up. But these parameters also provide an easy excuse to avoid dealing with important issues and pass them on to someone else.
* You should avoid configuration parameters as much as possible. Before exporting a configuration parameter, ask yourself: “will users (or higher-level modules) be able to determine a better value than we can determine here?” When you do create configuration parameters, see if you can compute reasonable defaults automatically, so users will only need to provide values under exceptional conditions.
* Use discretion when pulling complexity downward; this is an idea that can easily be overdone.
* For e.g. a text class that reflects the user interface by implemeting the functionality of the backspace key. It might seem that this is good, since it pulls complexity downward. However, adding knowledge of the user interface to the text class doesn’t simplify higher-level code very much, and the user-interface knowledge doesn’t relate to the core functions of the text class. In this case, pulling complexity down just resulted in information leakage.
