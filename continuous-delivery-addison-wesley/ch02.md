1. If you don’t have absolutely every source artifact of your project in version control, you won’t enjoy any of the benefits of the practices that we discuss to reduce your software’s cycle time and increase its quality.
2. Configuration information can be injected in the application at either:

   * Build time (inside binaries)
   * Packaging time (inside JARs)
   * Deployment time
   * Run time
3. Generally, we consider it bad practice to inject configuration information at build or packaging time. This follows from the principle that you should be able to deploy the same binaries to every environment so you can ensure that the thing that you release is the same thing that you tested. The corollary of this is that anything that changes between deployments needs to be captured as configuration, and not baked in when the application is compiled or packaged
4. It is often important to keep the actual configuration information specific to each of your application’s testing and production environments in a repository separate from your source code. This information generally changes at a different rate to other version-controlled artifacts. However, if you take this route, you will have to be careful to track which versions of configuration information match with which versions of the application
5. The following are few use-cases to consider when modeling configuration information:
   * Adding a new environment
   * Creating a new version of the application
   * Promoting a new version from one enivronment to another
   * Relocating a database server (E.g. if your DEV/SIT environments use the same DB server, updating the server host should be a simple processes as opposed to changing the hostname multiple times)
